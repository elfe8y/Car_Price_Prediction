# Car_Price_Prediction
The problem that we are going to solve is predicting a Car price prediction by using features. Our machine learning model is linear regression Model.

In this project tutorial, we are learning about Car price price prediction analysis with the help of machine learning. The objective of this problem is to predict the Selling_Price of a Car.
